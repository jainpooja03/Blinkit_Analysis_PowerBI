1. **Total Sales Performance:** Evaluated the overall revenue generated from all items sold, identifying peak sales periods and trends.
2. **Average Sales Analysis:** Analyzed the average revenue per sale, providing insights into customer spending behavior and pricing strategies.
3. **Item Sales Count:** Determined the total number of items sold, helping to assess product demand and inventory efficiency.
4. **Customer Satisfaction:** Measured the average rating of sold items to understand customer preferences and areas of improvement.

## Tools Used
